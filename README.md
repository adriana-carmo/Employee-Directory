### Description 
This application was created to show an employee directory with React technology. This assignment required to break up the application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.
### <a name="userstory"></a>User Story
As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.
### <a name="business"></a>Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

### Acceptance Criteria

Given a table of random users generated from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/), when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 

The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the users by at least one property.

### Technology
